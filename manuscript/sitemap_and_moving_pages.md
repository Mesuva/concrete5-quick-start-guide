# Sitemap and moving pages

Pages can be re-ordered and moved between sections via the Sitemap.

Either:

* Click on the Dashboard button and select the **Sitemap** option, or
* Click on the **Pages** button on the toolbar and view the sitemap there.

## To re-order pages

Drag and drop pages displayed within the sitemap tree by *their page icons*. 
New icons will appear on the sitemap to show where you are moving the page to.

### Changing page nesting

If you drag a page and drop it onto another page, you will be given the option to move or copy the page beneath that page. The options are:

**Move** - if you want to place the page under the page you dropped it on

**Alias** - if you wish the page to appear in navigation in another section, but keep the page in the same location in the sitemap

**Copy** - if you wish to make a full copy of the page in the new location (i.e. you wish to then edit it and change content)
