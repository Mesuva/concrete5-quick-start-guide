## Adding Images
Images can be added in two ways:

* By using an Image block.
* By editing a Content block and placing an image directly within the content.

## Adding YouTube videos
Add a 'YouTube Video' block to embed a youtube video.
Paste in the address of the video from youtube (e.g. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABCDEF) into the YouTube URl field and press 'Add'.

## To copy blocks to the clipboard
Blocks can be copied to a 'clipboard' within concrete5, allowing them to be easily copied between pages. To copy a block:

* Put the page into Edit Mode
* Click on the block you wish to copy and select 'Copy To Clipboard' from the popup menu

## To place blocks from the clipboard
1. Select the **Add Content (Plus)** button on the top toolbar. The block toolbar will slide in from the left.
2. At the top of the panel, click the dropdown and select **Clipboard** from the options.
3. Blocks within the clipboard will be displayed. Drag the block you wish to place into an editable area.
