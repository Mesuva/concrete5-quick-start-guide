# File Management

Images and files can be uploaded either via the Files section within the Dashboard, or directly at the time that they are added to a page.

## Access the Files page of the Dashboard

Click the **Dashboard** button on the toolbar and select **Files**.

## Uploading and managing files

Within the File Manager individual files can be clicked on to present a context menu, where they can be previewed, downloaded and deleted.

## To upload new files

Files can be dragged onto this page to automatically upload them, or the blue **Upload Files** link can be clicked.

## Adding files and links to pages

Once files have been added to the File Manager, the files can be linked to via blocks such as the **Content** block, **File** block and **Image** block.

When selecting files from blocks, the File Manager will appear, where you can click on an file to select it, or at this point upload a new file.
