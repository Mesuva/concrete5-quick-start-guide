Q> ## What are the 'Meta Title' and 'Meta Descriptions' used for?
Q>
Q> A page's metadata is information about a page that isn't displayed directly on the page, but can be automatically read by search engines. Use these fields to specify the title and description of a page that appears within a search engine result. Often these changes are performed as part of *Search Engine Optimization*, or SEO.
